                During the design and construction of an experimental physics 
                facility (EPF), a heterogeneous set of engineering disciplines, 
                methods, and tools is used, making subsequent exploitation of 
                data difficult. Distributed Information Services for Control Systems (<h:outputLink value="#{msgs.discs}" target="_blank">DISCS</h:outputLink>) 
                is a framework for building high-level applications for commissioning, operation, 
                and maintenance of an EPF. It provides programmatic as well as graphical interfaces 
                to its data and services.
                
                Central Configuration Database System (CCDB) is a module in DISCS; it is a software tool that 
                assists in managing the configuration of an EPF.                    
                It stores physical and logical information about the accelerator and its component systems:
                devices, device types, device properties, relationships among devices, data on installation, alignment, and signals.
                This includes information about magnets, RFQs, RF cavities, diagnostic devices, 
                solenoids, power supplies, valves, pumps etc.

            <p>Most of the information in CCDB can be accessed programmatically, using any language (C, C++, Java, Fortran, Python, Tcl/Tk etc) 
                and from within most tools such as MATLAB,  using CCDB's Application Programming Interface (API). The API is described in
