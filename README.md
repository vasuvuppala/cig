# Cycles in Graphs

This application compares performance of different algorithms to check if a directed graph has a cycle.                  
It generates a random directed graph, runs the algorithms against the graph, and compares their execution time.
For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the graphs are connected.
Currently, it implements two algorithms.
